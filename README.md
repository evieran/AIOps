# AIOps
A collection of AI-powered projects aimed at enhancing operational efficiency within IT services. This repository contains three key projects that focus on root cause analysis, predicting service request loads, and building a self-service help desk. These projects are intended for educational purposes and demonstrate the application of various machine learning and data processing techniques.

# 1. Root Cause Analysis
Incident Reports in ITOps usually state the symptoms. Identifying the root cause of these symptoms quickly is key to reducing resolution times and improving user satisfaction. This project aims to streamline this process using machine learning techniques.

## Installation
- pandas
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn

# 2. Predicting Service Request Loads
This project focuses on predicting service request loads, helping to understand the patterns and optimize resource allocation. It represents hourly total service requests for 5 weeks and utilizes time-series analysis.

## Installation
- pandas
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

# 3. Self-Service Help Desk
The Self-Service Help Desk project aims to automate assistance by recommending FAQs based on user queries. By using natural language processing techniques, it can understand and respond to various queries.

## Installation
- pandas
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- gensim
